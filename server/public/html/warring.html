		<p style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			You are a ruler of a kingdom during the heart of the middle ages. To your 
			dismay, a rival kingdom has popped up surprisingly close to yours. You must 
			prove to the world that your kingdom is the greatest!
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			There are two ways to win Warring Kingdoms. The kingdom with the most 
			collected food at the end of 500 turns wins. However, you can also win by 
			razing the opponent's keep.
