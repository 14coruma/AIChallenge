		<p style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			The goal of mancala is to move stones from your side of the board 
			into your goal. The bottom player moves stones from the bottom six 
			holes to the right goal, and the top player moves stones from the 
			top six holes to the left goal. The player with the most stones in 
			their goal at the end of the game wins.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			To move, choose one of the six holes on your side of the board. The 
			stones in that hole are then picked up, and dropped off one at a time 
			in the next holes (moving clockwise). The game ends when one of the 
			players no longer has any stones on their side of the board.
		</p>
		<b style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			Special cases:
		</b>
		<p style="margin-left: 48px; width: 66.66%;">
			• If on your move the last stone dropped is in your goal, then you 
			can take another turn.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 48px; width: 66.66%;">
			• If the last stone dropped is in an empty hole on your side, and 
			there are stones in your opponents hole opposite you, then the stones 
			are "captured". Your last stone and your opponent's captured stones 
			are all placed in your goal.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 48px; width: 66.66%;">
			• When the game ends, one player will likely still have stones on their 
			side of the board. These remaining stones count towards their score.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			Of course, the easiest way to understand these rules is to try playing 
			the game yourself! Go ahead and try it out at <a href="/play">/play</a>.

		<p style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			Like all games at AI Tourney, the game state is stored in JavaScript 
			Object Notation (JSON). This is what the mancala JSON looks like:
		</p>
		<div style="margin-left: 48px;" class="w3-code jsHigh notranslate">

			&emsp;"id": (number), // The gameID<br>
			&emsp;"game": "mancala",<br>
			&emsp;"players": [<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"username": (string)<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"pos": (0 or 1) // The player's position (bottom==0, top==1)<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;},<br>

			&emsp;"board": [<br>
			&emsp;&emsp; 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, // [0-6] are bottom 6 holes and goal<br>
			&emsp;&emsp; 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, // [7-11] are top 6 holes and goal<br>
			&emsp;],<br>

			&emsp;"gameOver": (0 or 1), // Whether the game is over (1) or not (0)<br>

		<p style="margin-left: 24px; width: 66.66%;">
			Making your move is fairly simple in mancala. Just print the index 
			number of the hole of the stones that you want to move. For the bottom 
			player, that would be indices 0 - 5. For the top player, that would 
			be indices 7 - 12.
